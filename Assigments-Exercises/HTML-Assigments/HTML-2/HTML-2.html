        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m Pinky, an aspiring IT professional and third-year college student passionate about exploring the creative and technical realms of technology. My journey so far has been fueled by curiosity, ambition, and a drive to continuously learn and innovate.</p>
        <p>Currently, Iâ€™m a GDG Web Dev Cadet under GDSC-PUP, a DOST-SEI Scholar, and a DataCamp Scholar. These experiences have allowed me to dive into challenging projects, refine my skills, and stay at the forefront of the IT field.</p>
        <p>Let's all have fun and do our best this year!</p>
        <p>BTW I'm an introvert so I find it hard talking to people in person, but I could probably talk in chat so don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
        <p>And ohh, I love Cats hihi >á´—< </p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>For my hobbies, I enjoy playing games like Mobile Legends and simulation gamesâ€”theyâ€™re always a fun way to unwind.</p>
        <p>I also love reading books; getting lost in a good story or learning something new is always exciting. Watching movies is another favorite pastime of mine, especially when I find something inspiring or entertaining to watch. ðŸ•®â˜•ï¸Ž</p>
